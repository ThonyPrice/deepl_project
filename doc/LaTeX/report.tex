This report is our final piece of work in the course DD2424, Deep Learning in Data Science. The overarching purpose is investigating convolutional neural networks (CNN's) while applying knowledge and techniques which we've acquired in during the course.

To thoroughly investigate the topic a CNN will be constructed in the most vanilla way possible. Different architectures is compared to another before moving on with one which performs better in terms of accuracy. In turns the network will be optimized by more sophisticated initialization, changing activation functions and additional additional optimization and regularization such as dropout and batch normalization. The effect of each modification will be documented and analyzed. Lastly, the results is discussed on their own and in context of other imageNet classifiers.


\section{Implementing a CNN}

\subsection{Evaluation architectures}

The basis of the CNN architecture is inspired by \cite{NIPS2012_4824}, it is summarized in figure \ref{fig:architecture}. However, it was implemented on the full dataset which features images of resolution $224\times224\times3$ while our images are $64\times64\times3$. Inspired by \textbf{insert 3 reports here} we decided to test three configurations, summarized in \ref{table:3_configurations}.

\subsection{Implementation specifics}

The network was written and implemented in Python 3.5, using the Keras Framework which runs on top of Tensorflow. Numpy was used for data management and Matplotlib to create the graphs. To assist in training and evaluating the networks, we used Google Cloud services for computation power. The specifications of the hardware used was:
\begin{itemize}
\item GPU
\item CPU
\item RAM
\item Disk space
\end{itemize}


\subsection{First important subtopic}

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
